Prerequisites:
Install Node.js and npm 
Install MongoDB: 
Clone the GitHub repository:
Click on the "Code" button and copy the repository URL.
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to store the project, and run the following command to clone the repository:

git clone <https://github.com/tanubaghel/Login-signup>

Install project dependencies:
Navigate into the cloned project directory using the terminal:

Once inside the project directory, install the required dependencies for both the frontend (React.js) and the backend (Node.js and Express.js) by running:
npm install


In the terminal, navigate to the backend directory and run the following command to start the Node.js server:
node server.js
In the terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and run the following command to start the Node.js server:
npm start
After running both the backend and frontend servers, you should see a message indicating that the backend server is running on a certain port (e.g., http://localhost:3000) and the frontend development server on another port (e.g., http://localhost:3001).
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3001 to access the MERN stack application.
That's it! If everything went smoothly, you should now have the MERN stack project running on your computer. You can now interact with the application and test its functionality locally. If you encounter any issues, check the terminal/console for error messages, and make sure you have followed all the installation and setup steps correctly.
